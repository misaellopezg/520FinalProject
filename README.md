# 520FinalProject
Final Project for EEP 520 Software Engineering for Embedded Applications

# Overview
The following project has the intent of using Enviro to create robot leading/following applications with the intent of applying flock behvaior with robot agents. The project consists of 4 sub-projects, each one building off the previous one. 
The following 4 subj-projects are explained in order:

1. Looping Leader
Looping leader creates a robot agent that loops in a circular path. The agent obtains path information from a static CSV file containing X-Y coordinates under the /paths folder. 
3. Robot Follower
4. Robot Train
5. Robot Flock
